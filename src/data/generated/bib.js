        "abstract": "This paper introduces GeoSpark an in-memory cluster computing framework for processing large-scale spatial data. GeoSpark consists of three layers: Apache Spark Layer, Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Spark functionalities that include loading / storing data to disk as well as regular RDD operations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDDs to support geometrical and spatial objects. GeoSpark provides a geometrical operations library that accesses Spatial RDDs to perform basic geometrical operations (e.g., Overlap, Intersect). System users can leverage the newly defined SRDDs to effectively develop spatial data processing programs in Spark. The Spatial Query Processing Layer efficiently executes spatial query processing algorithms (e.g., Spatial Range, Join, KNN query) on SRDDs. GeoSpark also allows users to create a spatial index (e.g., R-tree, Quad-tree) that boosts spatial data processing performance in each SRDD partition. Preliminary experiments show that GeoSpark achieves better run time performance than its Hadoop-based counterparts (e.g., SpatialHadoop).",

        "abstract": "Traffic simulators are important tools for tasks such as urban planning and transportation management. Microscopic simulators allow per-vehicle movement simulation, but require longer simulation time. The simulation overhead is exacerbated when there is traffic congestion and most vehicles move slowly. This in particular hurts the productivity of emerging urban computing studies based on reinforcement learning, where traffic simulations are heavily and repeatedly used for designing policies to optimize traffic related tasks.In this paper, we develop QarSUMO, a parallel, congestion-optimized version of the popular SUMO open-source traffic simulator. QarSUMO performs high-level parallelization on top of SUMO, to utilize powerful multi-core servers and enables future extension to multi-node parallel simulation if necessary. The proposed design, while partly sacrificing speedup, makes QarSUMO compatible with future SUMO improvements. We further contribute such an improvement by modifying the SUMO simulation engine for congestion scenarios where the update computation of consecutive and slow-moving vehicles can be simplified. We evaluate QarSUMO with both real-world and synthetic road network and traffic data, and examine its execution time as well as simulation accuracy relative to the original, sequential SUMO.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and geographic information systems (GIS), spatio-temporal Big Data (STBD) is experiencing exponential growth, marking the onset of the STBD era. Recent studies have concentrated on developing algorithms and techniques for the collection, management, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization of STBD. Researchers have made significant advancements by enhancing STBD handling techniques, creating novel systems, and integrating spatio-temporal support into existing systems. However, these studies often neglect resource management and system optimization, crucial factors for enhancing the efficiency of STBD processing and applications. Additionally, the transition of STBD to the innovative Cloud-Edge-End unified computing system needs to be noticed. In this survey, we comprehensively explore the entire ecosystem of STBD analytics systems. We delineate the STBD analytics ecosystem and categorize the technologies used to process GIS data into five modules: STBD, computation resources, processing platform, resource management, and applications. Specifically, we subdivide STBD and its applications into geoscience-oriented and human-social activity-oriented. Within the processing platform module, we further categorize it into the data management layer (DBMS-GIS), data processing layer (BigData-GIS), data analysis layer (AI-GIS), and cloud native layer (Cloud-GIS). The resource management module and each layer in the processing platform are classified into three categories: task-oriented, resource-oriented, and cloud-based. Finally, we propose research agendas for potential future developments.",

        "abstract": "Road network traffic data has been widely studied by researchers and practitioners in different areas such as urban planning, traffic prediction, and spatial-temporal databases. For instance, researchers use such data to evaluate the impact of road network changes. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale high-quality urban traffic data requires tremendous efforts because participating vehicles must install GPS receivers and administrators must continuously monitor these devices. There has been a number of urban traffic simulators trying to generate such data with different features. However, they suffer from two critical issues (1) scalability: most of them only offer single-machine solution which is not adequate to produce large-scale data. Some simulators can generate traffic in parallel but do not well balance the load among machines in a cluster. (2) granularity: many simulators do not consider microscopic traffic situations including traffic lights, lane changing, car following. In the paper, we propose GeoSparkSim, a scalable traffic simulator which extends Apache Spark to generate large-scale road network traffic datasets with microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed system seamlessly integrates with a Spark-based spatial data management system, GeoSpark, to deliver a holistic approach that allows data scientists to simulate, analyze and visualize largescale urban traffic data. To implement microscopic traffic models, GeoSparkSim employs a simulation-aware vehicle partitioning method to partition vehicles among different machines such that each machine has a balanced workload. The experimental analysis shows that GeoSparkSim can simulate the movements of 200 thousand vehicles over a very large road network (250 thousand road junctions and 300 thousand road segments).",

        "abstract": "The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime Internet-of-Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression imperative and challenging. This article mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of large-scale vessel trajectories and their graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations. The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.",

        "abstract": "Escalating traffic congestion in large and rapidly evolving metropolitan areas all around the world is one of the inescapable problems in our daily lives. In light of this situation, traffic monitoring and analytics is becoming the need of the hour. Real-time traffic analysis requires the processing of data streams that are generated continuously to gain quick insights. In order to processes stream data at a faster rate, we need technologies with high computing capacity. Big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka, with their capability of processing a massive amount of data, have made it possible to develop advanced and efficient data stream processing systems. The challenge of analyzing data streams for real-time prediction can be overcome by exploiting deep learning techniques. Taking this as a motivation, this work aims at developing a real-time data stream processing model for forecasting vehicle traffic, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn and train itself from traffic data. In the proposed analytical framework, the traffic data from an API is streamed using a distributed streaming platform called Kafka into the machine learning model in Apache Spark for analysis. The proposed model is aimed at predicting traffic flow information by integrating Spark and Kafka along with deep neural networks, that will be of great value to the citizens as well as the government by reducing the travel time, cost and energy, thus having a positive impact on the environment and the society.",

Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland\u2019s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.",

To assess road user interactions at a mid-block with heterogeneous traffic complexity, innovative trajectory-based data was used. In order to evaluate microscopic traffic flow parameters under various traffic flow conditions a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify severity grades based on specified indicators which are between generated at two mid-block sections.

When the traffic state is in equilibrium, the macroscopic flow model can be derived analytically from the corresponding CF model. In contrast to the microscopic CF model, calibrated based on trajectory data, the macroscopic representation of the fundamental diagram (FD) primarily adopts loop detector data for calibration. The different calibration approaches at the macro- and microscopic levels may lead to misaligned parameters with identical practical meanings in both macro- and micro-traffic models. This inconsistency arises from the difference between the parameter calibration processes used in macro- and microscopic traffic flow models. Hence, this study proposes an integrated multiresolution traffic flow modeling framework using the same trajectory data for parameter calibration based on the self-consistency concept. This framework incorporates multiple objective functions in the macro- and micro-dimensions. To expeditiously execute the proposed framework, an improved metaheuristic multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented that employs multiple enhancement strategies. Additionally, a deep learning technique based on attention mechanisms was used to extract stationary-state traffic data for the macroscopic calibration process, instead of directly using the entire aggregated data. We conducted experiments using real-world and synthetic trajectory data to validate our self-consistent calibration framework.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing availability of location-aware devices, passively collected big GPS trajectory data offer new opportunities for analyzing human mobility. Processing big GPS trajectory data, especially extracting information from billions of trajectory points and assigning information to corresponding road segments in road networks, is a challenging but necessary task for researchers to take full advantage of big data. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark and Sedona-based computing framework that is capable of estimating traffic speeds for statewide road networks from GPS trajectory data. Taking advantage of spatial resilient distributed datasets supported by Sedona, the framework provides high computing efficiency while using affordable computing resources for map matching and waypoint gap filling. Using a mobility dataset of 126 million trajectory points collected in California, and a road network inclusive of all road types, we computed hourly speed estimates for approximately 600,000 segments across the state. Comparing speed estimates for freeway segments with speed limits, our speed estimates showed that speeding on freeways occurred mostly during the nighttime, while analysis of travel on residential roads showed that speeds were relatively stable over the 24-h period. \u00a9 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Traffic congestion is common in most cities. It not only affects people's normal travel time but also causes more trafficcrashes. To solve the traffic congestion and reduce the corresponding hazards, it is necessary to quickly detect the location oftraffic congestion. In view of the fact that the trajectory data record the temporal and spatial information of moving objects, thisarticle presents two methods for the real-time detection of traffic congestion through real-time processing of trajectory data. Oneis to use distributed densit-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering to detect the location oftraffic congestion. The other is to perform distributed topology analysis of trajectory data to find congested areas. Finally,extensive experiments that involved using three real datasets to simulate both real-time detection methods on Spark Streamingdemonstrated the efficiency of the two methods.",

        "abstract": "Every day, hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing cars, continuously generate GPS positioning records. Simultaneously, the traffic big data platform of urban transportation systems has already collected a large amount of GPS trajectory datasets. These incremental and historical GPS datasets require more and more storage space, placing unprecedented cost pressure on the big data platform. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently compress these large-scale GPS trajectory datasets, saving storage cost and subsequent computing cost. However, a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms can only be executed in a single-threaded manner and are limited to running in a single-node environment. Therefore, these trajectory compression algorithms are insufficient to compress this incremental data, which often amounts to hundreds of gigabytes, within an acceptable time frame. This paper utilizes Spark, a popular big data processing engine, to parallelize a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms. These algorithms consist of the DP (Douglas\u2013Peucker), the TD-TR (Top-Down Time-Ratio), the SW (Sliding Window), SQUISH (Spatial Quality Simplification Heuristic), and the V-DP (Velocity-Aware Douglas\u2013Peucker). We systematically evaluate these parallelized algorithms on a very large GPS trajectory dataset, which contains 117.5 GB of data produced by 20,000 taxis. The experimental results show that: (1) It takes only 438 s to compress this dataset in a Spark cluster with 14 nodes; (2) These parallelized algorithms can save an average of 26\\% on storage cost, and up to 40\\%. In addition, we design and implement a pipeline-based solution that automatically performs preprocessing and compression for continuous GPS trajectories on the Spark platform.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing daily production of data in recent years, indexing, storing and retrieving huge amounts of data have become a common problem, especially for multi-dimensional big data. Although R-tree has proved to be efficient for indexing multi-dimensional big data, the R-tree suffers from the curse of dimensionality problem. Many researchers continue to use the R-tree in their studies as it is the most famous tree-like structure for indexing multi-dimensional data. However, with increasing numbers of dimensions in multi-dimensional data the performance of R-Tree will decrease. This paper proposes a new indexing structure called Parallel Indexing System Structure based on Spark (ParISSS), which is an efficient system for indexing multi-dimensional big data, to overcome these problems. ParISSS introduces six types of computing nodes, the reception-node is used to insert and index data, the normal-node is used to store indexed data, the resolution-node is used to distribute a reception-index to a normal-node, the representative-node is used to receive queries from the user, and the reply-node and check-node are used to send the results to the user. We also introduced BR*-tree structure to improve the storing and searching processes. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our system, comparing several indexing systems. The experimental results show that ParISSS outperforms other indexing systems.",

        "abstract": "Vehicles\u2019 trajectory prediction is a topic with growing interest in recent years, as there are applications in several domains ranging from autonomous driving to traffic congestion prediction and urban planning. Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services.",

        "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have widely studied road network traffic data in different areas such as urban planning, traffic prediction and spatial-temporal databases. For instance, researchers use such data to evaluate the impact of road network changes. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale high-quality urban traffic data requires tremendous efforts because participating vehicles must install global positioning system(GPS) receivers and administrators must continuously monitor these devices. There have been some urban traffic simulators trying to generate such data with different features. However, they suffer from two critical issues (1) Scalability: most of them only offer single-machine solution which is not adequate to produce large-scale data. Some simulators can generate traffic in parallel but do not well balance the load among machines in a cluster. (2) Granularity: many simulators do not consider microscopic traffic situations including traffic lights, lane changing, car following. This paper proposed GeoSparkSim, a scalable traffic simulator which extends Apache Spark to generate large-scale road network traffic datasets with microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed system seamlessly integrates with a Spark-based spatial data management system, GeoSpark, to deliver a holistic approach that allows data scientists to simulate, analyze and visualize large-scale urban traffic data. To implement microscopic traffic models, GeoSparkSim employs a simulation-aware vehicle partitioning method to partition vehicles among different machines such that each machine has a balanced workload. The experimental analysis shows that GeoSparkSim can simulate the movements of 300 thousand vehicles over a very large road network (250 thousand road junctions and 300 thousand road segments) and outperform the existing competitors.",

This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied.
