        "abstract": "Road network traffic data has been widely studied by researchers and practitioners in different areas such as urban planning, traffic prediction, and spatial-temporal databases. For instance, researchers use such data to evaluate the impact of road network changes. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale high-quality urban traffic data requires tremendous efforts because participating vehicles must install GPS receivers and administrators must continuously monitor these devices. There has been a number of urban traffic simulators trying to generate such data with different features. However, they suffer from two critical issues (1) scalability: most of them only offer single-machine solution which is not adequate to produce large-scale data. Some simulators can generate traffic in parallel but do not well balance the load among machines in a cluster. (2) granularity: many simulators do not consider microscopic traffic situations including traffic lights, lane changing, car following. In the paper, we propose GeoSparkSim, a scalable traffic simulator which extends Apache Spark to generate large-scale road network traffic datasets with microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed system seamlessly integrates with a Spark-based spatial data management system, GeoSpark, to deliver a holistic approach that allows data scientists to simulate, analyze and visualize largescale urban traffic data. To implement microscopic traffic models, GeoSparkSim employs a simulation-aware vehicle partitioning method to partition vehicles among different machines such that each machine has a balanced workload. The experimental analysis shows that GeoSparkSim can simulate the movements of 200 thousand vehicles over a very large road network (250 thousand road junctions and 300 thousand road segments).",

        "abstract": "Escalating traffic congestion in large and rapidly evolving metropolitan areas all around the world is one of the inescapable problems in our daily lives. In light of this situation, traffic monitoring and analytics is becoming the need of the hour. Real-time traffic analysis requires the processing of data streams that are generated continuously to gain quick insights. In order to processes stream data at a faster rate, we need technologies with high computing capacity. Big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka, with their capability of processing a massive amount of data, have made it possible to develop advanced and efficient data stream processing systems. The challenge of analyzing data streams for real-time prediction can be overcome by exploiting deep learning techniques. Taking this as a motivation, this work aims at developing a real-time data stream processing model for forecasting vehicle traffic, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn and train itself from traffic data. In the proposed analytical framework, the traffic data from an API is streamed using a distributed streaming platform called Kafka into the machine learning model in Apache Spark for analysis. The proposed model is aimed at predicting traffic flow information by integrating Spark and Kafka along with deep neural networks, that will be of great value to the citizens as well as the government by reducing the travel time, cost and energy, thus having a positive impact on the environment and the society.",

Functional and shape parameters were estimated using the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm. Statistical metrics were used to assess the performance and model fitness in all categories of linear, exponential and logarithmic, and complex forms of v-k relationships for different resolutions. The theoretical analysis revealed that certain relationships satisfy all the static properties and that only one satisfies both the dynamic properties of traffic behavior. Highly parameterized forms had the lowest errors. However, the linear form of model developed by May and Keller has high application potential.",

        "abstract": "As location-sensing devices and apps become more prevalent, the scale and availability of big GPS trajectory data are also rapidly expanding. Big GPS trajectory data analytics offers new opportunities for gaining insights into vehicle movement dynamics and road network usage patterns that are important for transportation studies and urban planning among other fields. Processing big GPS trajectory data, consisting of billions of GPS waypoints and millions of individual trajectories is a challenging yet important task for researchers from these different domains. In this research, we propose an Apache Spark-based geo-computing framework for using big GPS trajectory data to estimate vehicle miles travelled, an important metric used by both federal and state highway agencies in the United States for transportation planning. The computing challenge lies in scaling the processing of billions of raw GPS points data as well as the steps for map matching for a statewide road network consisting of thousands of road segments. In this work, we develop a scalable map-matching module that considers both the spatiotemporal information of GPS waypoint sequences and topologic information of road network for the State of Maryland while striking a balance between matching accuracy and computing time. We processed 19.8 million raw GPS trips consisting of approximately 1.4 billion GPS waypoints collected in Maryland during a four-month period in 2015 to estimate vehicle miles travelled for Maryland\u2019s road network. The estimation results show that using big GPS trajectory analytic methods is promising for obtaining accurate and stable vehicle miles travelled estimates.",

        "abstract": "Traffic congestion is common in most cities. It not only affects people's normal travel time but also causes more trafficcrashes. To solve the traffic congestion and reduce the corresponding hazards, it is necessary to quickly detect the location oftraffic congestion. In view of the fact that the trajectory data record the temporal and spatial information of moving objects, thisarticle presents two methods for the real-time detection of traffic congestion through real-time processing of trajectory data. Oneis to use distributed densit-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering to detect the location oftraffic congestion. The other is to perform distributed topology analysis of trajectory data to find congested areas. Finally,extensive experiments that involved using three real datasets to simulate both real-time detection methods on Spark Streamingdemonstrated the efficiency of the two methods.",

        "abstract": "Every day, hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing cars, continuously generate GPS positioning records. Simultaneously, the traffic big data platform of urban transportation systems has already collected a large amount of GPS trajectory datasets. These incremental and historical GPS datasets require more and more storage space, placing unprecedented cost pressure on the big data platform. Therefore, it is imperative to efficiently compress these large-scale GPS trajectory datasets, saving storage cost and subsequent computing cost. However, a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms can only be executed in a single-threaded manner and are limited to running in a single-node environment. Therefore, these trajectory compression algorithms are insufficient to compress this incremental data, which often amounts to hundreds of gigabytes, within an acceptable time frame. This paper utilizes Spark, a popular big data processing engine, to parallelize a set of classical trajectory compression algorithms. These algorithms consist of the DP (Douglas\u2013Peucker), the TD-TR (Top-Down Time-Ratio), the SW (Sliding Window), SQUISH (Spatial Quality Simplification Heuristic), and the V-DP (Velocity-Aware Douglas\u2013Peucker). We systematically evaluate these parallelized algorithms on a very large GPS trajectory dataset, which contains 117.5 GB of data produced by 20,000 taxis. The experimental results show that: (1) It takes only 438 s to compress this dataset in a Spark cluster with 14 nodes; (2) These parallelized algorithms can save an average of 26\\% on storage cost, and up to 40\\%. In addition, we design and implement a pipeline-based solution that automatically performs preprocessing and compression for continuous GPS trajectories on the Spark platform.",

        "abstract": "Vehicles\u2019 trajectory prediction is a topic with growing interest in recent years, as there are applications in several domains ranging from autonomous driving to traffic congestion prediction and urban planning. Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services.",
